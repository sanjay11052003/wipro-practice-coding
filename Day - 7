     Employee e1 = new Employee(1, "abc", 55000.00, "development");
Employee e2 = new Employee(11, "xyz", 43500.00, "development");
Employee e3 = new Employee(5, "fname", 100000.00, "production");
Employee e4 = new Employee(21, "name123", 75000, "support");
Employee e5 = new Employee(17, "someName", 85000,"development");


ArrayList<Employee> empList = new ArrayList<>(); 
empList.add(e1);
empList.add(e2);
empList.add(e3);
empList.add(e4);
empList.add(e5);
double sum = 0;
int count =0;
//print average salary
//write your code here
for(Employee a : empList )
{
    if(a.getDepartment() == "development")
    {
        sum += a.getSalary();
        count +=1;
