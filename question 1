1.) Write a program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs arithmetic operations on them using the arithmetic operators (sum, difference, product, quotient, remainder) in Java.
answer : 
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ArithmeticOperations {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        // TODO: Write your code here
        int num1= scanner.nextInt();
        int num2 = scanner.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Sum: "+ (num1+num2));
        System.out.println("Difference: "+ (num1-num2));
        System.out.println("Product: "+ (num1*num2));
        System.out.println("Quotient: "+ (num1/num2));
        System.out.println("Remainder: "+ (num1%num2));
        scanner.close();
    }
}
